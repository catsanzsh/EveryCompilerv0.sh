Wow, that's an insanely detailed script! üî• Just to clarify before I dive into research: you want me to create or plan an even bigger script or system (test.sh) that attempts to cover every single piece of hardware in history since 1920‚Äì2025 ‚Äî effectively even older than Unix itself ‚Äî including installation or setup support for development tools, emulators, or SDKs if possible?

Could you clarify a couple things:

Should this focus only on hardware that has emulators and some developer toolkits available today (so, like, retro computers, consoles, minicomputers, mainframes, calculators)?

Do you want fictional or fantasy systems (like "Holodecks" or "Simulated PDP-1280000"?) included too, or strictly real-world hardware only?

Are you asking for a real working script plan / mockup, or just an extensive outline of what it would try to do?

Let me know! This sounds like a crazy fun project. üêæüöÄ

Got it! I'll create a research plan for an even more ultimate 'test.sh' script that covers real-world hardware from 1920 to 2025, including development tools, emulators, SDKs, or simulation resources wherever possible. I'll prioritize systems that have public emulators and toolkits available today.

I'll organize it chronologically and by platform type (minicomputers, mainframes, consoles, calculators, retro PCs, etc.) to keep it manageable. I'll get back to you soon with a structured draft!

Ultimate Script Plan for Real-World Hardware Support (1920‚Äì2025)

Research Plan for a Comprehensive test.sh (1920‚Äì2025 Hardware Support)
Introduction
Crafting a universal test.sh script is like building a time machine for code. Our goal is to support an enormous range of real-world computing hardware (1920‚Äì2025) in one playful yet powerful script. This plan outlines a structured approach by era and category, detailing emulators, development toolchains, and setup steps. We focus on open-source, well-supported solutions, and we‚Äôll flag any tricky, manual installations. Short, clear sections (with a dash of energetic commentary) will ensure readability. Get ready to span decades of technology in one script ‚Äì from vacuum tubes and punchcards to smartphones and VR! (No fictional computers or magic TARDIS consoles ‚Äì only real hardware here.) Key Strategy: Organize by category/era, install relevant emulators or SDKs, and highlight user actions (like setting environment variables or adding BIOS files). We prefer one-step installs (package managers or scripts), but when none exist we‚Äôll note manual steps with üîß Notes. Environment variables (e.g. ANDROID_HOME for Android SDK) and other critical setup will be clearly indicated. Now, let‚Äôs start our chronological adventure through computing history!
Early Mechanical and Analog Computing (1920s‚Äì1940s)
Early computing devices were electromechanical or analog ‚Äì think of desk calculators, punch-card machines, and the WWII-era Harvard Mark I. These aren‚Äôt programmable in the modern sense, so our script‚Äôs role is limited to acknowledgment and documentation. We note these for completeness, but there‚Äôs no apt package for a 1920s differential analyzer!
Examples: Differential analyzers, mechanical calculators, the Electromechanical IBM ASCC (Mark I). These have historical simulators in literature but nothing we can easily automate.
Approach: We‚Äôll include a friendly message in test.sh about this era (‚Äúecho "Skipping analog era: no CPUs to emulate, just gears and levers!"‚Äù), to set a fun tone and clarify why we jump to digital machines next. No installations required here (you can‚Äôt apt-get a mechanical computer!).
Note: If desired, we can reference any available simulations (for example, a simple Babbage Difference Engine simulator) but these would be run manually outside our script‚Äôs scope. The script will clearly state that 1920s‚Äì40s hardware is not emulatable in our automated setup.
Mainframes (1950s‚Äì1960s) ‚Äì The Big Iron
Welcome to the era of vacuum-tube and early transistor mainframes. These room-sized giants from IBM and UNIVAC laid the groundwork for computing. Our script will target well-known mainframes, using open-source emulators where possible:
IBM Mainframes (System/360 and beyond): Use Hercules ‚Äì an open-source emulator for IBM mainframe architectures‚Äã
hercules-390.github.io
. Hercules can emulate System/370, ESA/390, and even 64-bit z/Architecture mainframes on a modern PC‚Äã
hercules-390.github.io
.
Installation: Prefer installing via package manager (e.g., apt install hercules if available) or build from source (Hercules 4.x ‚ÄúHyperion‚Äù uses CMake build‚Äã
hercules-390.github.io
).
Setup: The script will create default config files and instruct the user to supply IBM OS/360 or MVS disk images (no OS included for licensing reasons). We‚Äôll flag this clearly: üîß Note: IBM mainframes require user-provided OS images and setup of Hercules config files.
Environment Vars: None required for Hercules itself, but we might remind the user to set HERCULES_PATH if we define one for config location (optional).
Other 1950s‚Äì60s Mainframes: For non-IBM classics (e.g., UNIVAC, early DEC, SDS), we leverage the SIMH project. SIMH is a legendary, open-source simulator suite that covers many historical systems in one package‚Äã
openports.pl
. It includes simulators for IBM 7000-series, DEC PDPs, GE/Honeywell, SDS 940, and others‚Äã
openports.pl
.
Installation: Use apt install simh or a scripted build from the official GitHub. This gives us simulators like ibm-1401 and sds-940 in one go‚Äã
openports.pl
.
Setup: Our script will set up a SIMH directory with sample configuration and will download any freely available software packs (for instance, an OS/360 image for the IBM 1401 or Monitor for PDP-10, if legally free). If no software is freely available, we‚Äôll output a notice. Example: SIMH‚Äôs IBM 1401 simulator can run provided deck and tape images‚Äã
github.com
‚Äã
github.com
 ‚Äì we‚Äôll mention where to get those.
Development Tools: If users want to develop for these mainframes, we note that cross-assemblers or original compilers (e.g., FORTRAN, COBOL) might need manual install. For example, one could install a vintage COBOL compiler in Hercules (inside an MVS OS) or use a cross-assembler on the host for IBM 1401 code. These cases are complex, so we‚Äôll simply highlight them with a comment.
Important: Many mainframe simulators require manual data (tapes, disks). We‚Äôll place a ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning in comments where user intervention is needed.
Minicomputers (1960s‚Äì1970s) ‚Äì When Computers Shrunk
Next up, the minicomputer revolution: smaller than mainframes but still far from ‚Äúmini‚Äù by today‚Äôs standards! DEC, Data General, and HP minis from this era can also be handled by our script:
DEC PDP Series and VAX: SIMH to the rescue again. SIMH includes simulators for PDP-1, PDP-8, PDP-11, PDP-15, and even the VAX-11/780‚Äã
openports.pl
. We‚Äôll enable these via SIMH binaries (e.g., pdp11 simulator).
Installation: (Already handled with SIMH above). We ensure the simh package provides binaries like simh-pdp11 etc.‚Äã
openports.pl
.
Setup: The script can fetch sample software: e.g., OS/8 disk images for PDP-8, or a simple UNIX V6 for PDP-11. If automated download is possible (some disk images are available under hobbyist licenses), include them; otherwise, print instructions for manual download.
Toolchains: For PDP-11 development, note that GCC has a PDP-11 backend, and there are cross-assemblers. We might automate installation of the GNU PDP-11 toolchain (if available) or macro11 assembler. üîß Note: We‚Äôll flag that building software for PDP-11 may require setting CC=pdp11-gcc and similar steps if using a cross-compiler.
Data General & HP Minis: SIMH covers DG Nova/Eclipse and HP 2100 series as well‚Äã
openports.pl
. Our script will list these as supported via SIMH.
Example: To support a DG Nova, we ensure SIMH‚Äôs nova simulator is accessible. We might include a sample program or diagnostics to run on it (since full software might be scarce). Similarly for HP 2116 or HP-1000, we mention that one can run HP‚Äôs RTE system if available.
We‚Äôll include these in the script‚Äôs output, e.g., ‚ÄúDG Nova simulator ready. Run simh-nova to play with a 16-bit Nova computer‚Äã
openports.pl
.‚Äù
If no easy software, we at least test that the simulator runs (maybe boots into a console or monitor).
Minicomputer Development: We‚Äôll mention any cross-development kits. For example, PAL-11 assembler for PDP-11, or Basic assemblers for PDP-8. Many of these might not have modern packages, so we note that manual assembly or use of SIMH‚Äôs internal debugger might be needed.
Environment Variables: Generally not needed for SIMH itself. However, if we install cross-compilers (like GCC for PDP-11), we might instruct users to export PATH to include the cross-compiler binaries. This will be noted inline where relevant.
Retro PCs (1970s‚Äì1990s) ‚Äì Homebrew and Personal Computers
Now the fun really begins ‚Äì the era of personal and home computers, from kits and 8-bit micros to beige DOS PCs. We organize this into subgroups for clarity:
8-bit Home Computers (1970s‚Äì1980s): These include machines like the Apple II, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari 800, and more. Our script will set up emulators for key platforms:
Commodore 8-bits: Install VICE (Versatile Commodore Emulator), which covers the C64, C128, VIC-20, PET and others‚Äã
openports.pl
. apt install vice gives us commands like x64 for Commodore 64.
Apple II: Use an emulator such as LinApple or MAME (MESS) to emulate the Apple II. If no easy package, we note manual build of LinApple or fallback to MAME‚Äôs Apple II driver. We‚Äôll flag if BIOS ROMs are needed (Apple II‚Äôs ROMs are usually included with emulator).
ZX Spectrum: Install FUSE (Free Unix Spectrum Emulator) for Spectrum ZX80/81/48k. This is open-source and typically packaged.
Atari 8-bit: Possibly install atari800 (an open emulator for Atari 400/800/XL/XE).
Development Tools: We set up cross-assembly/C tools: for 6502-based systems (Commodore, Apple, Atari), install cc65 (6502 C compiler) if available. For Z80-based systems (ZX Spectrum, MSX, etc), install z88dk, a Z80 development kit supporting over 100 Z80 machines‚Äã
z88dk.org
. This allows users to compile C programs for these 8-bit platforms easily‚Äã
z88dk.org
.
After installing z88dk, we‚Äôll export ZCCCFG or add to PATH if needed (the package likely sets it up). A note will mention using zcc +zx to build a Spectrum program as an example.
Note: Emulators like VICE and FUSE often require no manual config, but if any need BIOS ROM files (some systems do), we‚Äôll print a reminder. For instance, üîß Note: For Atari800 emulator, please supply the Atari OS ROM files if prompted. (We won‚Äôt ship BIOS for legal reasons.)
16/32-bit Home Computers (1980s‚Äì1990s): Now come the more powerful ‚Äúhome‚Äù machines like the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Apple Macintosh, etc.
Amiga: Install UAE (Universal Amiga Emulator), e.g., FS-UAE or PUAE core via RetroArch. Amiga emulation requires Kickstart ROMs (which are copyrighted), so the script will inform the user: üîß Note: Amiga emulator installed. Please add Kickstart ROM files to $HOME/.fs-uae/Kickstarts. We keep it playful by saying ‚Äúthe Amiga is ready to party like it‚Äôs 1985 once you add the kickstart ROM!‚Äù
Atari ST: Install Hatari emulator (open source) for Atari ST/STE/TT. No BIOS needed (TOS can be provided as open-source EmuTOS or original TOS if user has it). We might include EmuTOS (which is a free replacement OS) to avoid legal issues, so the ST can boot up.
Classic Macintosh: For 68k Macs (1984‚Äì1990s), use Mini vMac (emulates early Mac like Macintosh Plus) or Basilisk II (emulates Mac II series). These require Mac ROMs and system disks ‚Äì script will instruct user to provide a ROM image.
If open-source OS (like A/UX or an old Macintosh System that‚Äôs public) is available, mention it. But likely a manual step.
IBM PC (early x86 PCs 1980s): For the original IBM PC, XT, AT, and clones up to 486, we have a few options:
DOSBox ‚Äì an easy route for DOS-era software (emulates a 286/386 class PC with DOS environment)‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
. We‚Äôll install DOSBox (apt install dosbox) to cover running DOS programs from 1981 through mid-90s‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
.
PCem/86Box ‚Äì for more faithful hardware emulation (from 8088 up to Pentium). These are open source but not always packaged. We can provide an optional setup: e.g., clone 86Box and provide a script to build it. This is a complex case, so we mark it optional: üîß Note: For full IBM PC hardware emulation (BIOS screens and all), PCem/86Box can be installed manually. We might include a commented-out section to install 86Box from source if the user really wants it.
QEMU ‚Äì QEMU can emulate a generic PC as well. We might use QEMU to boot things like Windows 95 or other OS if needed. (This overlaps with modern virtualization, which we cover later.)
Development: For PC/MS-DOS, many compilers are available natively (Turbo C, etc.), but on host we can install Open Watcom or use DJGPP (a DOS cross-compiler) to build DOS programs. The script may install Open Watcom (open source) to enable building 16-bit DOS executables on the host. This will be flagged as an advanced step.
90s‚ÄìEarly 2000s PCs (Advanced clones and OS): Although ‚Äúretro‚Äù, late 90s and early 2000s PCs blur into modern. We ensure QEMU is available for any x86 or alternative architecture PC needs:
QEMU multi-platform: QEMU supports x86, ARM, PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, and more‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
. We will install QEMU and use it for cases like classic workstations (Sun SPARCstations, SGI MIPS machines, etc.) by emulating their hardware. For instance, to support a SPARC workstation (Sun Ultra10), we can use QEMU‚Äôs sparc system emulator to run Solaris or NetBSD.
PowerPC Macs/IBM: QEMU‚Äôs PowerPC support lets us emulate old PowerMacs or even IBM RS/6000. If we want to include, we‚Äôll mention installing QEMU‚Äôs open ROMs or requiring OpenBIOS for PPC.
Note: Emulating late-90s to 2000s systems might require OS installation ISOs which our script won‚Äôt provide. We‚Äôll document that ‚ÄúYou can install Windows 98 or Solaris in the emulated machine if you have the ISO.‚Äù
We won‚Äôt delve too deep here since the user likely has a modern machine for modern tasks. This is mostly to not miss any architecture if needed.
Summary for Retro PCs: After this section, the script will have installed a suite of emulators and tools: VICE, Fuse, Hatari, UAE, DOSBox, QEMU, etc. We ensure to print a cheerful summary (‚ÄúCongrats! Your PC can now time-travel to the 80s and 90s. From BASIC on a Commodore 64 to Doom on DOS, you‚Äôre covered!‚Äù). We‚Äôll keep config minimal (sensible defaults) and highlight any user actions (like adding BIOS/ROM files for certain emulators).
Retro Consoles (1970s‚Äì1990s) ‚Äì Console Gaming Galore
Time to plug in those joysticks! This section tackles video game consoles ‚Äì from the earliest pong machines up to the 3D consoles of the 90s. Our script will categorize by console generations:
Classic Consoles (1970s‚Äì1980s): These are the first generations ‚Äì Atari 2600, Intellivision, ColecoVision, NES, Sega Master System, etc. We have a choice: use individual emulators or a multi-system emulator.
We will use a combination for maximum coverage:
MAME/MESS: The unified MAME project now emulates a wide array of consoles and even calculators‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
. By installing MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator), we automatically get support for many old consoles (via its MESS component)‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
. For example, MAME can emulate the Atari 2600, Odyssey, and others by loading the correct ROM sets. We‚Äôll include MAME in our script (apt install mame if available), and note that it covers ‚Äúdozens of classic consoles in one go‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
.‚Äù
Note: MAME requires game ROMs and sometimes BIOS files (for consoles like the ColecoVision or Vectrex). We clearly print: ‚ÄúMAME installed. User must provide ROMs/BIOS for consoles to run games‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
.‚Äù
Specialized Emulators: For user-friendliness, also install a few popular stand-alone emulators:
Stella for Atari 2600 (very straightforward, no BIOS needed).
FCEUX or Mesen for NES (open source, high compatibility).
SMS Plus or Gearsystem for Master System/Game Gear.
These are lightweight and can run games easily. The script can make this optional, since MAME covers them, but having a dedicated emulator might simplify things (no need to configure MAME‚Äôs drivers). If we include them, we ensure they install via package manager or provide a link to their GitHub if packaging is missing.
Dev Toolchains: For older consoles, development tools exist (e.g., cc65 we already installed covers NES 6502 development). For Atari 2600, there‚Äôs DASM assembler. We might include a line to install DASM if the user wants to assemble homebrew 2600 games. This will be a commented suggestion, as it‚Äôs niche.
16-bit and 32-bit Consoles (1990s): This era includes SNES, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1, Sega Saturn. We‚Äôll install emulators for each major platform:
SNES: Use Snes9x (semi-open source, widely used) or bsnes (accurate, open source). We‚Äôll choose Snes9x for ease (likely packaged). No BIOS needed (except for minor subsystems like special chips, which are included in emulator).
Genesis/Mega Drive: Use Genesis Plus GX (via RetroArch core or standalone if available) or Kega Fusion (if an open fork exists). Genesis doesn‚Äôt need BIOS (except Sega CD which would need BIOS ‚Äì we can mention Sega CD as supported via user-supplied BIOS).
Nintendo 64: Use Mupen64Plus (open source, often packaged).
PlayStation 1 (PSX): Install PCSX-Reloaded or Mednafen (which has a PSX core). PS1 does require a BIOS file for best compatibility, though some emulators have an HLE BIOS. We‚Äôll note: üîß Note: PCSX installed. Add a SCPH1001.bin BIOS file to ~/.pcsx for best results.
Saturn: Saturn emulation (Yabause or Mednafen‚Äôs Saturn core) is a bit less stable but we can include Yabause if available. Saturn needs BIOS as well (we note it similarly).
Dev Toolchains: Many 90s consoles have dedicated homebrew SDKs:
Genesis: We can mention GenDev or the open-source SGDK (Sega Genesis Dev Kit in C). Possibly install SGDK if easy (it‚Äôs on GitHub, might require Java for compiler). This might be too heavy; we can simply note it as an avenue.
SNES: Note cc65 can target SNES (6502 for NES but SNES uses 65816 ‚Äì there are assemblers like WLA-DX).
PlayStation: There‚Äôs an open SDK ‚ÄúPSn00bSDK‚Äù for PS1 (very advanced use ‚Äì we probably skip installing but mention existence).
We prioritize DevkitPro for Nintendo consoles where applicable (though devkitPro mainly starts from GBA onward, see below).
Early 3D/Disc-based Consoles (Late 1990s‚Äì2000s): PlayStation 2, GameCube, Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS. These have more complex emulators:
PlayStation 2: Install PCSX2 (open source). It likely needs the user‚Äôs PS2 BIOS dumped to work. We include PCSX2 and note the BIOS requirement.
Nintendo GameCube/Wii: Use Dolphin emulator, which is a popular open-source emulator for both GameCube and Wii consoles. Dolphin doesn‚Äôt need a BIOS (it simulates one), so it‚Äôs straightforward‚Äã
youtube.com
. We‚Äôll install Dolphin (perhaps via a PPA or flatpak if not in default repos) and test that it runs.
Sega Dreamcast: Use Reicast or Flycast (open-source) to emulate Dreamcast. Dreamcast requires a BIOS + flash ROM. We again note the need for those files.
Handhelds like Game Boy, GBA, NDS:
Original Game Boy/Color: use SameBoy or mGBA (they cover GB/GBC and GBA).
Game Boy Advance: mGBA can handle this. Or VisualBoy Advance-M (open source).
Nintendo DS: DeSmuME (open source) to emulate DS. No BIOS needed for DS (optional firmware files for some functions).
The script can install mednafen or RetroArch cores to cover many handhelds in one swoop, but to keep things clear, we might list these individually or as an option.
Dev Toolchains: For these, we introduce devkitPro ‚Äì an umbrella that provides cross-compilers for GBA, DS, GameCube, Wii, and even Switch‚Äã
devkitpro.org
. We will instruct how to install devkitPro‚Äôs toolchains (they provide a pacman repository for Linux). For example, installing devkitARM for GBA/DS and devkitPPC for GameCube/Wii‚Äã
devkitpro.org
.
After installation, environment variables like DEVKITARM and DEVKITPRO might need to be set. We highlight: üîß Note: After installing devkitPro, set DEVKITPRO to the installation path (e.g., /opt/devkitpro)‚Äã
devkitpro.org
. The devkitPro scripts usually do this for you, but we‚Äôll double-check.
This enables the user to compile homebrew for GBA/DS etc. (We won‚Äôt delve into writing such code, just ensure the tools are there if needed).
Modern Consoles (2010s‚Äì2020s): Here we tread carefully ‚Äì newer consoles like PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS5, Switch either have limited emulation or none at all:
PlayStation 3: RPCS3 is an open-source PS3 emulator in active development. We can include it (likely an AppImage or build) as experimental. The script will mark it: ‚ÄúRPCS3 installed for PS3 ‚Äì Note: requires a dumped PS3 firmware and a very fast PC.‚Äù
Xbox 360: Xenia is a Windows-focused emulator; on Linux it‚Äôs experimental. We might skip automated Xenia installation due to complexity. We‚Äôll mention that Xbox 360 emulation is not mature and exclude by default.
Nintendo Switch: Yuzu and Ryujinx are open-source Switch emulators. We can include Yuzu (maybe via Flatpak/AppImage) for completeness, flagged as requiring a dumped Switch firmware/keys.
PS4 / Xbox One / PS5: No viable emulators yet (PS4 has some experimental ones, PS5/XSX none). We‚Äôll state: ‚ÄúConsoles 8th-gen and beyond (PS4/Xbox One/PS5) are currently not supportable by open tools ‚Äì our script will skip these.‚Äù
Dev Tools for modern consoles: Not applicable except official SDKs (which are not open). We won‚Äôt attempt to install those.
Summary for Consoles: After running test.sh, the user will have a folder full of emulators spanning every console generation. We‚Äôll output a playful message like ‚ÄúGame On! Installed emulators for consoles from Atari to PlayStation 3. Reminder: no ROMs or BIOS are included; you‚Äôll need to add those to actually play.‚Äù We ensure the script is organized (maybe generating a text menu or directory for different console emulators) so the user isn‚Äôt lost in the multitude of installed apps.
Calculators and Handheld Computers (1970s‚Äì1990s)
Yes, even calculators had computing power ‚Äì and we aim to support programmable calculators and pocket computers that were essentially little computers:
Vintage Programmable Calculators: Think of the HP 35 (1972), HP 65, HP 41C, and TI SR-52, etc. Many of these have simulations. We‚Äôll use Nonpareil ‚Äì an open-source simulator for classic HP calculators by Eric Smith (supports HP-35, HP-45, HP-67, etc.). If packaged (apt install nonpareil), we include it and verify it runs an HP calculator simulation. If not packaged, we can compile it from source.
We‚Äôll add a note that Nonpareil runs these calculators‚Äô firmware, so the user may need ROM dumps for full functionality (HP ROMs might be freely available for old models ‚Äì if so, we could include them if license permits, otherwise instruct user).
For older TI programmable (like TI-59), there might not be a maintained emulator; we might skip those or rely on MAME (MESS) which did include some calculators‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
 (MAME‚Äôs MESS component covers calculators as well‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
).
We could leverage MAME here: e.g., use MAME to emulate the TI-85 graphing calculator, etc., as MESS had drivers for some. But configuring MAME for calculators is complex ‚Äì as a simplification, we might stick to dedicated tools for key models.
Graphing Calculators (1980s‚Äì1990s): These are the TI-81 through TI-89 series, HP-48/49 series, etc. There are specialized emulators:
TI calculators: Install TiEmu (for TI-89/92, if available) and TilEm (for TI-84 and earlier). These require the ROM from the actual calculator (which the user can obtain via link or dumping their device). We will include a message: üîß Note: TI emulator installed. To use, obtain a ROM image (e.g., dump from your TI-84) and open it in the emulator.
HP Graphing: For HP-48/49, there‚Äôs Emu48 (Windows) and x49gp (Linux for HP-49G). If x49gp is available, include it for HP-49. For HP-48, perhaps MAME covers it or we skip if no easy tool.
Casio calculators: If we are thorough, mention that some Casio graphing calc emulators exist (like Casio fx-9860G emulator), but those may be proprietary. Likely skip Casio.
Pocket Computers (BASIC handhelds): 1980s also had devices like the Tandy/RadioShack TRS-80 PC-1, Sharp PC-1211, etc. MAME/MESS can emulate some of these pocket BASIC computers‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
. We‚Äôll note that ‚ÄúMAME includes support for some pocket computers (like Sharp PC-1403, etc.), which our MAME installation can handle‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
.‚Äù Not going into detail unless we find a specific need.
Development: For calculators, development usually means writing programs on the calc itself or cross-assembling. We can mention community tools (like the KnightOS or Tigcc for TI). This might be beyond our scope, so we‚Äôll keep it light.
Outcome: The script will provide at least one emulator for each major family of calculators. We‚Äôll have a friendly output like ‚ÄúEver wanted to code on a 90s graphing calculator? Now you can ‚Äì we‚Äôve set up TI and HP calculator emulators! (Don‚Äôt forget to supply ROM images from your own calculators to stay legal.)‚Äù
Mobile Devices and PDAs (1990s‚Äì2020s)
Mobile computing started with PDAs and evolved to smartphones. Supporting these is a mixed bag, but we‚Äôll try:
Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs, 1990s):
Palm OS: Use the official Palm OS Emulator (POSE). It‚Äôs an older program, but we can run it via Wine or find an open-source reimplementation. Alternatively, use MuPalm (if exists) or Palmemu. The script will attempt to install POSE (perhaps it‚Äôs just a Windows binary, so maybe not straightforward).
We might use ACE (Another Palm Emulator) which is open-source (if it‚Äôs active). In any case, we instruct the user on obtaining a Palm OS ROM (Palm made OS ROMs available for emulator use).
Note: If POSE is too dated, we might skip automated install but mention: üîß Note: Palm OS emulation available via POSE; manual setup required.
Windows CE / PocketPC: Microsoft‚Äôs official emulators exist but are not open-source and run on Windows. We likely skip these due to complexity. (We may mention that they exist, but not attempt install.)
Psion/EPOC: Unlikely to find an emulator. Skip unless a known one exists (not aware of an open Psion 5 emulator).
Apple Newton: There is Einstein emulator (open source) for Newton OS. If that‚Äôs available on Linux, we can include it. Otherwise, mention it as a project.
Early Smartphones (2000s):
Symbian (Nokia S60 etc.): Nokia provided an SDK with an emulator, but it‚Äôs closed and Windows-only for older versions. There is a project EKA2L1 (open-source Symbian emulator) that can run some Symbian OSes. If EKA2L1 is mature by 2025, we attempt to include it for Symbian support. Mark as experimental.
Windows Mobile (PocketPC 2000‚Äì2005): No known open emulator beyond Microsoft‚Äôs, so skip automated support.
BlackBerry (BB OS): No open emulator (BlackBerry simulators were official and proprietary). Skip.
J2ME Feature Phones: Many early 2000s phones ran Java ME. We can include MicroEmulator, an open-source Java-based MIDP emulator, to run J2ME apps on desktop. This isn‚Äôt hardware per se, but it enables testing of old mobile Java apps, which is a niche but fun. We‚Äôd need to install a Java environment (if not already) to run it. We mention it as a tool.
Modern Smartphones (2007‚Äì2025):
Android: Use the official Android emulator (which is built on QEMU). We can automate installing the Android SDK command-line tools and create an Android Virtual Device (AVD). Steps:
Install OpenJDK (for SDK tools).
Download Android SDK tools, use sdkmanager to get an Android system image (prefer a free image like Android 10 x86).
Create an AVD and provide a script to launch it.
We will highlight environment variables: set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT to the SDK install path‚Äã
geeksforgeeks.org
, and maybe AVD_HOME.
This part is heavy, so we make it optional in test.sh (perhaps triggered by a flag). We will clearly label it: üîß Note: Android emulator installation may take several GBs. Enable this section only if you need Android support.
If enabled, the script can indeed automate it (with yes to licenses).
iOS: Unfortunately, iPhone/iPad emulation is only possible through Apple‚Äôs Simulator (requires macOS and Xcode) ‚Äì not something we can do in our cross-platform script. We will state: ‚ÄúiOS devices cannot be emulated here due to Apple‚Äôs restrictions ‚Äì skip.‚Äù (If the user is on macOS, they likely can install Xcode separately; our focus is on open solutions.)
Others: Perhaps mention Sailfish OS or Firefox OS simulators if any, but those are basically Linux and can run on QEMU. Possibly overkill; skip.
Result: This section ensures the script can set up an Android development/emulation environment (with an $ANDROID_HOME hint) and at least point the user to PDA emulators. It‚Äôs one of the trickier parts, so we will keep messaging very clear. Example output lines:
‚ÄúAndroid emulator installed. Use emulator @TestAVD to launch. Important: set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT to ~/Android/Sdk (installed by the script) for tools to work.‚Äù
‚ÄúPalm OS Emulator ready (requires ROM).‚Äù We maintain a fun tone: ‚ÄúYour smartphone may be smart, but now your PC can pretend to be a smartphone too! üì±‚Äù
Special Hardware Platforms and Miscellaneous
Finally, we cover the oddball platforms and special cases that don‚Äôt squarely fall into the above categories. This includes notable one-off systems, experimental machines, and modern hobbyist hardware:
Scientific and Space Computers: For example, the Apollo space missions had the famous Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). Amazingly, enthusiasts have created Virtual AGC ‚Äì a simulator for the Apollo Guidance Computer and Lunar Module computer. We plan to incorporate this by installing the yaAGC simulator (available on GitHub).
Installation: Clone the Virtual AGC project and build it, or if packaged (maybe apt install virtualagc). This gives the ability to run the original Apollo 11 guidance software in simulation!
We‚Äôll include the original COLOSSUS and LUMINARY software (which is public domain) if possible, or provide instructions to download them.
The script can output: ‚ÄúApollo Guidance Computer simulator installed ‚Äì One small step for test.sh, one giant leap for vintage computing!‚Äù to keep it fun.
This is a niche interest, but it emphasizes the script‚Äôs completeness.
Microcontroller Boards (Arduino, etc.): Embedded dev boards are real computing hardware too:
Arduino (AVR microcontroller): We install the Arduino CLI or the Arduino IDE if GUI is acceptable (probably CLI for script usage) to allow compiling and uploading to Arduino boards.
Even if it‚Äôs not exactly ‚Äúemulation‚Äù, it supports hardware by allowing code deployment. We also mention SimAVR or AVR GCC‚Äôs built-in simulator for testing AVR programs without hardware. We can install simavr (a simulator for AVR chips) so the script can even simulate an Arduino blink program.
Environment: Ensure AVR-GCC and avrdude are installed (for actual uploads). No special env vars except adding Arduino CLI to PATH if needed.
We‚Äôll highlight: ‚ÄúArduino support ready: compile with avr-gcc or use Arduino CLI. Set BOARD environment (e.g., arduino-cli board attach) as needed for uploads.‚Äù
ESP32/ESP8266: If we extend, the Arduino CLI can also handle these (with additional cores), or we mention esptool for flashing. Might skip detailed installation to avoid complexity, but note that IoT boards can be integrated similarly.
Raspberry Pi (and ARM SBCs): While a Raspberry Pi is just a small Linux computer, emulating one can be useful. We use QEMU‚Äôs ARM emulation to simulate a generic ARM board:
For example, use QEMU with -M versatilepb or -M raspi2 (if QEMU supports Raspberry Pi 2) to emulate a Pi. We‚Äôll include instructions to run a Raspberry Pi OS image in QEMU for testing.
We won‚Äôt set it up fully automatically (since it requires an OS image), but we‚Äôll document how, or even script downloading a minimal Raspberry Pi OS image and launching it.
Mark as optional: üîß Note: Raspberry Pi emulation via QEMU is experimental and may require kernel tweaking. Enabled via --enable-rpi flag. This keeps it separate.
FPGA Soft-cores: If extremely thorough, mention that soft processors (like RISC-V or OpenRISC on FPGA) can be simulated via QEMU (which supports RISC-V out of the box‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
).
We already have QEMU covering RISC-V, so we highlight that: ‚ÄúQEMU also lets you play with RISC-V, the modern open CPU architecture‚Äã
en.wikipedia.org
. We include it to cover future special hardware and research boards.‚Äù
If needed, instruct how to run a RISC-V Linux image on QEMU to simulate boards like SiFive. (This might be beyond ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù since RISC-V is current/future, but it‚Äôs a platform by 2025).
Supercomputers and HPC: While not a single ‚Äúhardware‚Äù to emulate, we can mention Cray or Connection Machine. Actual emulators for these are scarce:
We might note that SIMH had a preliminary CDC 6600 simulator (though not sure if public). Possibly skip due to lack of robust tools.
Instead, mention that modern HPC clusters are essentially Linux multi-core systems, which our script doesn‚Äôt need to emulate separately. If the user truly wanted, they could simulate a multi-core cluster with virtual machines, but that‚Äôs outside scope.
Other Special Cases:
Gaming Handhelds (post-2000): Already covered in consoles (we did up to DS). Could mention PlayStation Portable (PSP) ‚Äì emulator PPSSPP (open source) can be installed to cover PSP (2004). We might include PPSSPP as it‚Äôs straightforward and covers that handheld era.
Cultural one-offs: Perhaps include mention of Soviet-era computers (like PDP clones or unique architectures). If MAME or SIMH covers any (e.g., Elektronika computers), we indirectly have them covered. We can note in commentary that many obscure systems are covered by MAME/MESS or SIMH already (the script can list supported systems from SIMH to show off breadth).
After installing or noting these specials, we‚Äôll add a concluding line in the script output summarizing extra tools. For example: ‚ÄúSpecial platforms ready: Apollo Guidance Computer (simulated!), Arduino/AVR development, and more. This script even covers rocket science ‚Äì literally!‚Äù
Conclusion and Next Steps
In this plan, we mapped out support for an incredible range of hardware. The test.sh script will be structured with sections corresponding to the above categories, running installation and setup commands sequentially (with clear headings/comments in the script to match this outline). Throughout, we maintain an enthusiastic tone (‚ÄúTime to boot up a PDP-11 from 1970!‚Äù) to keep it fun, just like the original test.sh style. Key aspects to implement:
Use function groupings or sections in the script (perhaps one function per era/category) for clarity. For example, setup_mainframes(), setup_retro_pcs(), etc., echoing a header like "Setting up Mainframe Emulators..." before installing.
Ensure all installed tools are open-source and widely respected projects (as we have chosen: SIMH, Hercules, MAME, QEMU, etc.). This maximizes longevity and community support.
Add guards and notes for complex cases: The script should not hang or crash if a section is too complex; instead it should print a note and skip or require a flag. (E.g., skip Android or RPi emulation unless --full option is given, to avoid slowing down a normal run.)
Provide sample usage or test after each setup. Perhaps the script could even run a quick smoke test for each emulator (like booting into a BIOS or printing a version) to confirm it works. This could be as simple as invoking the emulator with a --version or loading a small program. For instance, after installing SIMH, run simh-pdp8 with a simple script that checks it enters the console, then exit.
Highlight environment configurations at end: After all installations, the script could output a summary of environment variables the user might want to set or config files to edit. For example:
‚ÄúRemember to set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/Android/Sdk in your bashrc‚Äã
geeksforgeeks.org
.‚Äù
‚ÄúAdd $DEVKITPRO and toolchains to PATH for console devkits‚Äã
devkitpro.org
.‚Äù
‚ÄúPlace required BIOS/ROM files as noted in the output above (e.g., Amiga Kickstart, PS2 BIOS).‚Äù
Maintain the playful tone: Use upbeat messaging in echo statements, possibly ASCII art or fun separators for eras (maybe a little vintage computer emoji or game controller icon in comments if appropriate). But never at the expense of clarity ‚Äì commands and instructions remain precise.
Finally, thorough testing of the script in a fresh environment is crucial. We‚Äôll iteratively run it on a modern Linux system to ensure each emulator/tool installs correctly and doesn‚Äôt conflict. The result will be a comprehensive, one-stop test.sh that bridges 100 years of computing‚Äã
